# Movie Recommendation System

Machine learning, using scikit-suprise, and data preperation using pandas, there are three reccomendation methods here. Collaborative-Based, Popularity-Based and Content-Based.

## Content-Based
This method uses a similarity matrix to determine the similarity of movies based on their descriptions. 

## Popularity-Based
This method calculates the weighted rating of each movie and recommends the top 10 highest rated movies. 

## Collaborative-Based
This method uses the SVD model from the surprise library.
